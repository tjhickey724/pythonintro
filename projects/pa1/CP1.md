# CP1 - Custom Calculator

Write a Python program which asks the user for their name
and prompts them for some numbers (integers and/or floats) 
and then does several calculations and prints out the answers nicely
with formatted printing (so fix the number of digits after the decimal point).

## Requirements
Your program should
1. ask for at least three values of types string, int, and float.
2. evaluate at least 3 different expressions storing the values in new variables
3. generate both integer and float results and print the results using formatted printing where the number of digits after the decimal point is fixed (e.g. 2)

## Examples
For example, you could write a program to convert dollars to different currencies.
Ask the user for the amount of dollars and then convert that into several different currencies

Or you could write a program to find the volumes of several different solids, 
e.g. find the volume of a sphere by asking for the radius,
then find the volume of a cylinder by asking for the radius and height,
then ....

Or you could write a program to calculate how much each person owes 
if three people go out to dinner and split the bill equally for a given tax and tip rate. 

Just pick something which demonstrates your ability to prompt the user for numbers, do calculations, 
and print the results out in a __nicely formatted__ way.

# What to hand in
Create 2 short narrated Zoom movies
1. Showing you running your program in VScode and explaining how to use it and how it meets the **Requirements**.
2. Showing you explaining each line of your program and how it works. Don't read the program, explain it at a higher level as if you were explaining it to a classmate or a fellow software engineer!

Cut/paste your code into the PA1 textbox in the Mastery Learning App and add a comment at the top with links to the two movies.
