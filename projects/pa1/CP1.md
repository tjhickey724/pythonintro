# CP1 - a Creative Programming assignment

Write a Python program which asks the user for their name
and prompts them for some numbers (integers and/or floats) 
and then does several calculations and prints out the answers nicely
with formatted printing (so fix the number of digits after the decimal point).

For example, you could write a program to convert dollars to different currencies.
Ask the user for the amount of dollars and then convert that into several different currencies

Or you could write a program to find the volumes of several different solids, 
e.g. find the volume of a sphere by asking for the radius,
then find the volume of a cylinder by asking for the radius and height,
then ....

Or you could write a program to calculate how much each person owes 
if they go out to dinner and split the bill equally for a given tax and tip rate.

Just pick something which demonstrates your ability to prompt the user for numbers, do calculations, 
and print the results out in a nicely formatted way.

# What to hand in
Create 2 short narrated Zoom movies
1. Showing you running your program in VScode and explaining how to use it
2. Showing you explaining each line of your program and how it works.

Cut/paste your code into the PA1 textbox in the Mastery Learning App and add a comment at the top with links to the two movies.
