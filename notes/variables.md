# Variables
Python allows you to store values in named locations in memories
and to use these valuation in various calculations (e.g. arithemtic).

Variable names are sequences of letters, digits, and underscores,
starting with a lowercase letter. There are [some additional restrictions as well](./variable_names.md)

You can store values in a variable using the = symbol.
You can also use variables in formulas and Python will look up the value stored in the variable, e.g.
``` python
a = 355
b = 113
print(a,b,a/b)
```

Formulas are evaulated using the usual PEMDAS rules.
