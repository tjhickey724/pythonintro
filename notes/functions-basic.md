# Basic Function Syntax and Semantics in Python

We can define a function in Python using the "def" keyword.
For example, here is the way to define a function print "Hello World"
and after that we call the function three times:
``` python
def say_hello():
    print("Hello World!")
say_hello()
say_hello()
say_hello()
```
In general, the format for this simple form of a function is
``` python
def NAME():
    statement1
    statement2
    ...
    statementn
```

where for now, the statements are either print statements
or function calls!
