# Problem Solving Strategies with Python

In this class we will follow the [7 step approach](https://adhilton.pratt.duke.edu/sites/adhilton.pratt.duke.edu/files/u37/iticse-7steps.pdf)
to solving problems in Python. The steps are
1. work an example
2. write down "exactly" what you did
3. generalize to a pseudocode algorithm
4. test your algorithm by hand
5. translate your algorithm to code
6. test your program
7. debug possibly returning to steps 3 or 5 as needed

We can further subdivide step 5 by having you write the code in a step-wise fashion
1. Write a simple program that does something but not everything
2. Debug it and get it working
3. If it is not complete, a
4. Add another feature to get it closer to your algorithm and return to 2
