# Setting up Visual Studio Code
In these notes we will be using visual studio code to write, run, and debug programs.

You should begin by visiting the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
and downloading vscode.

Next, add the Python Extensions to vscode by following [the vscode python instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial)

We will also be using Github Copilot to help us code, so you'll need to create a github account at [github.com](https://github.com/)

Then, you can add the github copilot extension using [these github copilot instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/quickstart)
