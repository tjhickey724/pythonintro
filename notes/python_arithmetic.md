# Python Arithmetic
Python allows you to work with four kinds of numbers
* integers like 5, 2023, -100, 0
* decimal numbers like 3.1415, 10.99, -2.718281828
* complex numbers like 1+2j   (where j is the imaginary number in Python)
* fractions: like 1/2 and 355/113

We will only look at the first two types. You can read about complex numbers and fractions on your own if interested.

## Operations
Python can be used like a calculator with the standard arithmetic operaitons, +,-,*,/
*  addition 5+2
*  subtraction 5-2
*  multiplication 5*2
*  division  5/2

But it has some additional operators
* integer division 15//2  (which throws a way the remainder, so 15//2 = 7 as 15=2*7 + 1)
* integer remainder 15%2  (which returns the remainder, fo 15%2 = 1 as 15 = 2*7+1)
* raising to a power 15**2  (which returns 225)


You can consult the official documentation to see all of the [Python numeric operators](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex)
