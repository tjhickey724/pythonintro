# Text Processing
In these notes we explore how to use Python to analyze a large textual dataset, for example a novel or play or research article.

## Prepare the text file
The first step is to find the text and convert it to a ".txt" file 
These files consist of a sequence of characters but with no fonts, highlighting, formating, etc.
A good source of text files is [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/).
You can download files which are out of copyright in a number of different formats, but
the one we want to analyze with Python is the "Plain Text" format.

For example, here is a link to the [Plain Text version of Frankenstein](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/84.txt.utf-8)

Let's download this file and store it in the folder we are using for our vscode projects.
You can download it by selecting the "Save As" option in the File menu. Let's store it in the file "frankenstein.txt"

## Cleaning the data
Whenever you work on a data set, the first step after downloading it is to prepare it for processing, also known as "cleaning the data".
In this case, the Project Gutenberg text has a prologue and an epilogue that are appended to the the text we're interested in.

The Prologue has meta-data and the Epilogue has information about how you can share this data.

The Prologue for this particular file (as of 6/20/2024) is
```

*** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FRANKENSTEIN; OR, THE MODERN PROMETHEUS ***
```
which ends in the line "*** START OF THE ..."
and likewise, the epilogue begin with a "***" line as follows
```
*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FRANKENSTEIN; OR, THE MODERN PROMETHEUS ***

Updated editions will replace the previous oneâ€”the old editions will
be renamed .....
```
We should load this text file into vscode and delete the prolog and epilogue before
processing (though we could also use Python to do this!!)
