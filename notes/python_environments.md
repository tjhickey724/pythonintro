## Python Environments

In this class we will get experience writing and running Python programs in several different environments.
In this note we give an overview of some of these:

### [Python tutor](https://pythontutor.com/python-compiler.html#mode=edit)

This is an educational web app that allows you to write and run Python programs 
and to observe step-by-step how the program creates and modifies elements of the memory.
One of the important goals of this course is for you to understand exactly what happens
when a Python program is run on a computer. We call this developing a Mental Model of
program execution. By the end of the course, you will be able to trace through a Python program
in exactly the same way that Python tutor illustrates..

Python Tutor is the environment we will use for the first few days in the course, and then we
will return to it when we introduce new concepts to help you develop your mental model.

### [Brython](https://brython.info)
This is an online Python interpreter which is convenient for writing and testing small pieces of code.

### [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
Visual Studio Code is probably the Integrated Development Environment
which is most widely used by Professional Developers and Computer Science students.
It has many features that allow you to efficiently write, debug, and run programs in
a wide variety of languages, including Python. We will start using this in Week 2 and it
will be our main environment.

### [Google Colab/Jupyter notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com/)
This is an online environment for writing Python programs and documentation explaining the code.

## LLMs -- Large Language Models

### [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app)
Google's LLM which is good at generating and explaining code, and is free.
Brandeis students get access to a more powerful version for free.

### [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
This is a powerful LLM, which consults the web when looking for answers,
and it is quite good at generating and explaining code.

### Many others
ChatGPT, DeepSeek, ...  There are many and many more are appearing each year!
