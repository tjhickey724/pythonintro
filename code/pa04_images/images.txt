The goal of this PA is to have students
get practice working with multidimensional arrays.
In this case,2d arrays of 3 tuples.

Interesting things to do 
* learn how to read and write images as 2d arrays of tuples
* learn how to modify images by looping over pixels
* combining images
* lightening or darkening images
* blurring an image
* converting color to grayscale or black/white

PA write a program to ask user for a image path
and then perform operations on it, e.g. 
convert it by averaging the r and g parameters
to simulate RedGreen color blindness.

I can create this on Tuesday and assign it on Wednesday.
On monday I'll give examples of using it to
