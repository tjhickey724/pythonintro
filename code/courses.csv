40,11,"<p><span>This is a seminar-style course where students will work on a project, and report their results in the form of a system demonstration or a typical research paper that is presented in conferences such as ACL, NAACL, and EMNLP. The main topics this year will be on Machine Translation (MT) and Dialogue Systems. Historically these two topics are quite distinct in the way they are approached. However, the wide adoption of deep learning techniques in NLP has brought the two topics closer, as both can be tackled in the sequence-to-sequence framework. In this course, we will provide an overview of these topics, covering data acquisition and preparation, model development, and system evaluation. </span></p><p></p><p><span>Specific to Machine Translation, we will examine statistical and neural approaches to MT, methods in creating and preparing parallel corpora to train MT systems, and metrics for MT evaluation. On the topic of dialogue systems, we will discuss rule-based, statistical, and neural approaches to chatbots and task-oriented systems. We will examine different components of a dialogue system â spoken language understanding, dialogue state tracking, and dialogue generation. The goal of the course is to help the student to either build a working prototype, or solve a problem in these areas.</span></p>",section,Open,1,0,Nianwen Xue Nianwen Xue xuen@brandeis.edu,,"['COSI', '216A']",COSI,216A,Topics in Natural Language Processing,False,1221,"<p>Prerequisites vary by topic.

It is about leading, but it might also be about misleading. It is more than just good intentions, charisma, a personal gift, or features of a person; it is about impact, serving justice, positive values and the community; it must be done right. When it is exercised properly, the good must ensue for most of all, while empowering the voiceless, the weak, the least privileged, the most at risk, the disenfranchised. That is why this course is not interested merely in a leadership that is just another word for power at any cost, just an instrument for any cause. All together, the class will be spotting responsible leadership, where the solutions of women and men of power respond to the problems of the people, to whom they are accountable for.

Systems of music notation spread rapidly across Europe, and took root as the way to record, archive, share, and (eventually) compose music. This graduate seminar course examines the form and function of music notation in western Europe, and how the writing down of music transformed music practice.

We typically assume that human attraction (and love) is much more nuanced and complex...but is it? Many features that humans find beautiful or attractive, such as small waists, curvy hips, and large eyes, can be tied to biological explanations. Even behavioral features, such as nurturing behaviors, may be attractive for adaptive reasons. In this course, we will explore and write about biological explanations for these and many other aspects of human attraction. Using an evolutionary perspective, we will examine global patterns of attraction and challenge stereotypes of beauty. Do nice guys really finish last? Do traditionally attractive features in western cultures&#39;such as low body weight&#39;actually provide an evolutionary benefit, or might some preferences be culturally derived?

But what exactly do we mean when we call something a distraction? How do distractions force us to attend to them, and why do we see this as a problem? In this course, we will explore how and why we draw the line between distraction and so-called ânormalâ or âhealthyâ attention. Borrowing analytical tools from the fields of medicine, psychology, philosophy, and cultural history and theory, we will examine both historical distractions (such as theater and film) and more contemporary ones (such as social media). We will also investigate the role played by distraction in such psychiatric disorders as ADHD and internet addiction. In analyzing these phenomena, we will develop a more nuanced understanding of how attention and distraction shape our experience of the world.

Science fiction, particularly, gets the readers excited about understanding how the world works and imagining their place in it. In this course, we use science fiction stories to build a fresh relationship with math and science and feel empowered to stay curious and ask questions. We attempt to answer some of the scientific questions by a powerful tool: mathematical modeling. As we embark on this journey, we learn how to become better friends with our computers by learning a little about their language. By the end of the course, MATLAB might become your favorite smart pocket calculator. The word âscience fictionâ might give you mixed feelings: if you have ever tried to imagine yourself in a science fiction world but it felt like an exclusive club, prejudiced based on gender identity, sexual orientation, race, disability, and more, this course gives you the chance to reimagine a more inclusive science fiction world. Every two weeks, we read a science fiction story by a diverse group of writers, including Octavia Butler, Nnedi Okorafor, Ken Liu, and Rebecca Roanhorse, who strive to make the science fiction community more inclusive. We also hear from a diverse group of speakers who discuss topics in race, gender, culture, and equity in scientific or science fiction communities. If the pandemic era has sparked your curiosity about the spread of diseases and you have found yourself watching documentaries on infectious diseases back-to-back, rejoice. In the first half of the course, we focus on topics in epidemiology and population growth, and ask questions like how long would it take for a vicious fungus to take over the world? Or if an alien parasite infected our planet, how could we model its spread as it takes over more human hosts? In the second half, we focus on bio-engineering models that inevitably lead us to questions surrounding climate change. Can we engineer our planet and control climate? As climate change has affected the frequency of natural disasters, can we predict earthquakes, wildfires, and hurricanes accurately? If all fails, is space going to be a second home for us? By the end of the course, we reevaluate our definition of science. What are our responsibilities towards, the consequences of, and limitations of using science to progress humanity? We will feel empowered and inspired to shape science into a more inclusive home for all. Special one-time offering, spring 2022.</span></p>"

This course invites students to explore the achievements and shortcomings of forensic science.

Course fee: $150.<br /><br />Encompasses the many facets that may present themselves to a researcher working in a laboratory setting. The primary goal of this course is to teach current methods in molecular biology in order to establish a foundational skill set that makes a student viable in today&#39;s research market. Along with this, enhancing the written format of acquired data, the art of presenting this data and scientific writing is also emphasized. Though the course meets during its scheduled time, the experimental designs contribute to real research projects from laboratories in the Biology department so that additional work will be required during off days and weekends depending on your time management. This time commitment simulates a research environment where students are responsible for their own experiments in order to prepare them for both a career in science and allow them to fully understand what attributes are necessary to be competent in the field of research. Students will be required to perform tasks when the class is not in session. Some of the techniques taught will include DNA isolation, DNA sequence analysis, generation of mutations, recombinant DNA cloning, RNA isolation, polymerase chain reaction including real-time quantitative PCR, yeast two hybrid systems, screening chemical libraries, Gateway &amp; Gibson cloning techniques, bacterial &amp; yeast strain constructions and DNA/RNA hybridization methods. There is a possible option of continuing the project as an independent researcher in the spring depending on the student and nature of the project. Currently we are massing useable data from past classes for publication purposes. This class has a large time commitment both during and outside of class time and should not be taken in conjunction with other research laboratories or internships. Please note that one of the goals of this course is to help place you in or on the career path you desire. Usually offered every year. Usually offered every year.<br />Vincent Sutera</p>"

Students will then choose their own research topic and text on neurodiversity, ranging from films such as Prozac Nation and Silver Linings Playbook to television series, such as Homeland and The Good Doctor. This course will help prepare students for academic research and writing, introducing them to peer reviewed research, academic databases, and the fundamentals of disciplinary conventions.

In fact, the same holds true for those in other scientific fields&#39;scientists must not only do science, but they, too, must write science. But what exactly are professional scientists writing? What motivates their composing and to whom do they write? What rhetorical choices do scientists make when communicating complex information? In this course, we&#39;ll examine the discursive and generic requirements scientists face when composing in different contexts for different audiences. By considering a number of professional scientific genres&#39;including research articles, grant applications, poster presentations, and public talks&#39;we will explore questions of accessibility, writerly agency, persuasion, and objectivity. You&#39;ll even have the opportunity to interview faculty members in the disciplines to learn about the writing tasks you might encounter as a working professional in your field.

This course will interrogate these seemingly conflicting narratives. We will first watch the classic John Ford western film, Stagecoach, in which the mysterious cowboy/outlaw character, Ringo Kid, helps to protect a group of innocent pioneer townsfolk on a dangerous stagecoach trip across the American Southwest. For the research essay, students select a topic and text of their choice, ranging from the film Pocahantas, to a painting by Georgia O&#39;Keefe, to a classic novel by John Steinbeck, in order to explore the idealization of the American West and the lingering effects of that idealization today.

While this course is centered around the concept of the self in European thought, it does not present an uncritical view of the very concept of âEuropeâ in the examination of individual and group identities. We will start with the exploration of self and society in HomerâsÂ <i>Odyssey</i>Â and then move through literary and philosophical reflections on what it means to be a person in what was once called the âwestern traditionâ. (To be clear, this course will engage in examining the notion of the âwestern tradition criticallyâ). This course will pay special attention to the way that challenges to âtraditionalâ notions of identity have contributed to a dynamic and at times violent debate about personhood, focusing especially on social forces like religion, race, colonialism, gender, sexuality, disability, and capitalism.

In the 1970s, the battle cry, &#39;You&#39;ve come a long way, Baby!&#39; pushed cigarettes as the hip accessories of feminism and the sexual revolution.

From its earliest origins as an exotic substance to its commodification and democratization at the hands of capitalism, sugar has shaped empires, fueled systems of slavery, and revolutionized the human diet. Even today, this commodity continues to shape our cultures, our vocabularies, our diets, our health, and our environment in surprisingly pervasive ways. Why and how has this seemingly ordinary substance had such an impact upon our lives, and how can we constructively manage and responsibly enjoy it in the global future? In this course, we will examine its nature and the complex history of human interactions with this sweet commodity through film, including Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, poetry, novels, blogs, and art. We will also engage with current debates over how to manage its public health and environmental impacts and how to remedy the injustices that still accompany its production.

If the American Dream is about the &#39;pursuit of happiness&#39; and we live in time of so much abundance, then why is there a seemingly equal amount of sadness, discontent, and rage? In this class we will explore the American Dream within the social, economic, and cultural context of capitalism. We will examine how this idea unfolds in film, such as the 2018 hit Sorry to Bother You and graphic novels.

This course will examine this question from various angles, using the films of Studio Ghibli as well as some popular television shows. Together, we will explore how anime creators use their unique cultural perspective to create universal messages about issues such as the environment, coming of age, and cultural belonging. At the same time, we will see how these creatorsâ limited perspective can lead to problems such as cultural appropriation and issues surrounding racial and gender representation.

During the early national period most corporations were public entities serving charitable, religious, or educational purposes. However, by end of the nineteenth century, private interests like insurance, manufacturing, and railroads dominated the corporate landscape. Corporations, over the course of the 19th and into the 20th century, amassed enormous political, economic, and social capital enabling them to challenge both American government and American labor. In this course, we will interrogate how the corporation became the dominant mode of business association in the United States as well as what role the law played in this transformation.

American literature, as a reflection of society, often depicts instances of political violence. Novels, poetry and short stories have a vexed and complicated relationship with history - are they just a representation of society as it is? Or can they be calls to action, provoking movements? In this course, we ask what political violence is and how it operates. Is that violence sometimes justified? If so, what conditions authorize it and what restrictions are there on its use? How much power does literature have to inspire or activate political action? What exactly is violence and what rhetorical and literary strategies are used to describe, validate or negate its use? âViolent Resistanceâ is envisioned as an introduction to these questions. In the course, we will investigate violent forms of American political protest through the lenses of some of the major theoretical approaches to violence, politics and literature available to us today. This is intentionally constituted as an interdisciplinary, cross listed course because we are fully convinced that interdisciplinary study not only offers a fuller, more rounded approach to the topic, but also because we are committed to the idea that each perspective broadens and deepens the other. As such, this course will incorporate methods from both disciplines. Special one-time offering, fall 2022.</span></p><p><span>Sarah Beth Gable and Miranda Peery</span></p>"
